"""Orchestrator-side algorithm runtime.

The config side (``prime_rl.configs.algorithm``) defines *what* an algorithm
is — a bundle of sampling and the per-token training signal. This package
turns the signal half into runtime objects (the sampling half is the env's
:class:`~prime_rl.orchestrator.sampler.Sampler`):

- one module per algorithm (``grpo``, ``echo``, ``max_rl``, ``rae``,
  ``hierarchical_grpo``, ``opd``, ``opsd``, ``sft``) — each named class owns
  its scoring hooks
  (``score_rollout`` / ``score_group``) and declares what it needs (loss
  component, a "teacher", ...). One instance per env, built by
  :func:`build_algorithm`. A new credit-assignment scheme is a new named class:
  subclass :class:`Algorithm`, assign advantages in the hook whose timing fits,
  and register it below.
- ``base`` — the :class:`Algorithm` base class, whose non-virtual
  ``finalize_rollout`` / ``finalize_group`` methods the pipeline drives.
  Advantages are per-token everywhere they are stored or shipped — there is no
  scalar advantage in the pipeline. An algorithm assigns credit in its scoring
  hook via ``Rollout.assign_advantages``: a scalar that is *broadcast* over the
  rollout's completion tokens (uniform credit, the common case), or an explicit
  full-length-N per-token list aligned to the concatenated sample token_ids
  (0.0 off-mask).
- ``routing`` — wire-field stamping: per-token component weight streams
  (rl / ce / ref_kl) and the per-token advantage stream.
