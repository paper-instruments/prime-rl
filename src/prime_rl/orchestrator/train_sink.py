"""TrainSink: three-level rollout sink for the training side.

1. ``process_rollout`` — eager per-rollout tokenization (overlaps with
   dispatcher producing more rollouts), then the env algorithm's
   ``finalize_rollout`` (rollout-local scoring + any reference I/O). Errored
   rollouts skip this.
2. ``process_group`` — filters errored rollouts, hands survivors to the env
   algorithm's ``finalize_group`` (advantages + per-sample wire stamping),
   runs the pre-batch filter pass.
3. ``process_batch`` — applies post-batch filter annotations and assembles
   the trainer-bound ``TrainingSample`` list. Returns a ``TrainBatch``.

``add()`` returns ``TrainBatch | None``. I/O concerns (ship to trainer,
save_rollouts, monitor.log) live on the orchestrator.
