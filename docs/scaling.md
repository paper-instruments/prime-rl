# Scaling

This page covers how to scale `prime-rl` from a single GPU to a 1000-GPU cluster: single-node and multi-node deployments, FSDP / expert parallelism / context parallelism, and throughput benchmarking. See [Training](training.md) for detailed documentation of the trainer configuration and [Inference](inference.md) for the inference configuration.

## Single-Node vs. Multi-Node Deployment

The `rl`, `sft`, and `inference` entrypoints all accept a `[deployment]` block (`type = "single_node"` or `"multi_node"`) that picks how the trainer / orchestrator / inference processes are placed across hardware. **Single-node** runs locally. **Multi-node** normally goes through [SLURM](#slurm); an infrastructure provider that already allocates a gang may instead use PrimeRL's [external-cluster interface](#externally-allocated-rl-clusters).

### Single-Node

#### RL Placement

`rl` defaults to 1 trainer GPU and 1 inference GPU. To give inference 6 GPUs with data parallelism and the trainer the remaining 2 on an 8-GPU node:

```bash
uv run rl @ rl.toml \
  --deployment.num-infer-gpus 6 \
  --deployment.num-train-gpus 2 \
  --inference.parallel.dp 6
```

The launcher allocates GPUs in order from `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` (or all visible GPUs): inference first, trainer next. To target a specific physical subset, pin `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` before launching.

For quick A/B ablations on the same node, run two RL instances side-by-side in separate tmux sessions, each pinned to half the GPUs and a separate inference port:

```bash
# session 1, GPUs 0–1, default port 8000
bash scripts/tmux.sh -s exp1 -o outputs/exp1
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 uv run rl @ rl.toml --output-dir outputs/exp1

# session 2, GPUs 2–3, port 8001
bash scripts/tmux.sh -s exp2 -o outputs/exp2
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3 uv run rl @ rl.toml \
  --inference.server.port 8001 \
  --orchestrator.model.client.base-url http://localhost:8001/v1 \
  --output-dir outputs/exp2
```

#### SFT and Torchrun

`uv run sft` handles distributed launch internally. To scale from 1 to N GPUs, set the deployment GPU count (or just let it pick up `WORLD_SIZE`). For non-default layouts, the manual equivalent is:

```bash
uv run torchrun \
  --nproc-per-node 8 \
  --local-ranks-filter 0 \
  src/prime_rl/trainer/sft/train.py @ sft.toml
```

`--local-ranks-filter 0` keeps console output to rank 0 only; per-rank stdout/stderr is still captured in `<output_dir>/logs/trainer/torchrun/`.

### Multi-Node

Multi-node deployments (RL or SFT) are normally launched via [SLURM](#slurm) — set `[deployment] type = "multi_node"` plus the matching `[slurm]` block, and the launcher writes the sbatch script that places inference, orchestrator, and trainer across the requested nodes with the inter-process wiring set up correctly. See [SLURM § Examples](#examples) for full configs.

#### Externally Allocated RL Clusters

Providers such as Modal can allocate a fixed gang and call PrimeRL once per node. Configure `[external_cluster]` instead of `[slurm]`, then use `build_external_node_plan()` in process or run the equivalent command on every provider rank:

```toml
[deployment]
type = "multi_node"
gpus_per_node = 8
num_infer_nodes = 1
num_train_nodes = 1

[external_cluster]
trainer_rdzv_port = 29500
consensus_port = 29503
startup_timeout = 300
shutdown_timeout = 60
termination_grace_period = 10
```

```bash
uv run external-cluster \
  --config rl.toml \
  --rank "$PROVIDER_RANK" \
  --addresses "${RANK_ORDERED_ADDRESSES[@]}" \
  --run-id "$UNIQUE_RUN_ID" \
  --local-state-dir "/tmp/prime-rl/$UNIQUE_RUN_ID/rank-$PROVIDER_RANK"
```

Provider ranks are ordered as inference nodes first, followed by trainer nodes. The first trainer hosts the orchestrator, torchrun rendezvous, ZMQ rollout transport, and NCCL weight-transfer control plane. Provider rank zero hosts a private all-rank failure-consensus socket. Every rank must receive the same unique run ID, complete rank-ordered IPv4 address list, and resolved configuration.

The provider owns allocation, model materialization, durable storage, and a synchronous per-rank finalizer. PrimeRL owns process placement, endpoint injection, local process groups, and cluster-wide shutdown. The output directory must be new and empty; external launch does not clean or resume an existing run. Each rank writes its own logs and checkpoint shards, and the provider must make those rank-owned files durable before acknowledging finalization. The shared storage must support distinct-file writers; it is not used for live control messages.

The control socket assumes an isolated, single-tenant provider network. A mismatched run ID, topology, configuration, peer disconnect, child failure, or finalizer failure aborts the whole gang. External launch currently supports whole-node, single-node inference replicas, static inference endpoints, dense models, ZMQ rollouts, NCCL weight transfer, and IPv4 addresses.

## Parallelism Knobs

### FSDP

FSDP2 is the default model sharding strategy. By default the trainer fully shards parameters, gradients, and optimizer state across the data-parallel mesh. Tweakable knobs:

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `trainer.model.dp_replicate` | Number of dimensions to **replicate** instead of shard. Set to 2 to run 2-way DP replication × FSDP sharding within each replica — useful for very large clusters where pure FSDP communication dominates. |
| `trainer.model.reshard_after_forward` | If `true` (default), parameters are resharded after the forward pass to free memory; the backward pass re-gathers. Set `false` to keep params resident — faster but more memory. |
| `trainer.model.fsdp_cpu_offload` | Offload params + grads + optimizer state to CPU. Big memory win, large throughput hit. |
| `trainer.model.optim_cpu_offload` | Offload only optimizer state. Mid-ground — small throughput cost, decent memory savings, especially at low GPU count. |

### Expert Parallelism

EP shards MoE expert weights across the EP mesh, dramatically reducing the FSDP communication volume per layer and improving the training throughput. EP is only available with the custom model implementation (`model.impl = "custom"` or `"auto"` for supported families).

`ep` defaults to `"auto"`, which resolves at startup to the largest valid EP degree up to 8. It loads the model config to read `num_experts`, then picks the biggest divisor of `num_experts` that also divides the FSDP island size (`world_size // dp_replicate`), is a multiple of `cp`, and is <= 8. For non-MoE models, resolves to 1 (no-op). Set `ep` to an explicit integer to override:

```toml
[trainer.model]
impl = "custom"
ep = 8                     # explicit EP degree; must divide num_experts
ep_comm_backend = "torch"  # or "deepep"
```

`ep_comm_backend = "deepep"` uses DeepEP's custom dispatch/combine kernels for speed, with two extra knobs (`deepep_num_sms`, `deepep_token_chunk_size`) — tune on your hardware.

### Context Parallelism

CP shards a single sequence across multiple GPUs along the token dimension — for long-context sequences. We reccomend using `ulysses` style CP for most of the models to get the most throughput. Some models (e.g. GLM-5) only support `ring` style CP. Wrong setting will be rejected on validation.

`ulysses` head-shards Q/K/V, so the CP degree must divide `num_attention_heads`. GQA models with fewer KV heads than the CP degree (e.g. NemotronH: 32 query heads, 2 KV heads) are supported via KV-head replication; the CP degree must then be a multiple of `num_key_value_heads`. Hybrid Mamba layers head-shard independently (`cp_mamba`), which requires the CP degree to divide `mamba_num_heads` and `n_groups`.

```toml
[trainer.model]
impl = "custom"
attn = "auto"                # auto = FA3 on Hopper, FA4 on Blackwell; or flash_attention_2/3/4
cp = 2                       # CP degree
cp_style = "ulysses"         # "ring"
```

### Activation Checkpointing and Offloading

| Knob | Memory ↓ | Throughput ↓ |
|---|---|---|
| `trainer.model.ac` | large | ~25% |
| `trainer.model.ac.mode = "selective"` | medium | small | 
| `trainer.model.ac_offloading` | extra | a bit more |

AC and AC offloading are enabled by default (full mode). For the best memory/throughput tradeoff, switch to selective AC (custom impl only):

```toml
[trainer.model.ac]
mode = "selective"
targets = ["norm", "attn_proj"]  # see Reference for the full list per architecture
```

`ac_offloading` is also on by default with `max_inflight_activations = 5`. We've observed this feature to be very effective, lowering the peak memory usage by 30-40% in some cases, while only lossing ~3-5% of throughput. To disable either, set `model.ac = "None"` or `model.ac_offloading = "None"`.

### Optimizer Offloading

Offloading optimizer states to CPU is enabled by default (`optim_cpu_offload = true`) — a near-free memory win at low GPU counts:

```toml
[trainer.model]
optim_cpu_offload = true   # already the default
```

Mutually exclusive with `fsdp_cpu_offload`. Also incompatible with `trainer.max_concurrent_runs > 1` (multi-tenant training) — set `optim_cpu_offload = false` for multi-run. Muon doesn't support `fsdp_cpu_offload` but does support `optim_cpu_offload`.

### LM Head Chunking

The vanilla LM head materializes a `[batch * seq, vocab]` logits tensor on every step — a major memory tax when the vocabulary is large (often >100K). `fused_lm_head_token_chunk_size` swaps in a custom fused linear + logprob/entropy kernel that streams through `chunk_size` tokens at a time, avoiding the materialization. It defaults to `1024` for RL training:

```toml
[trainer.model]
fused_lm_head_token_chunk_size = 1024       # default
# fused_lm_head_token_chunk_size = "disabled"  # vanilla LM head
```

Drop the chunk size further when peak memory is still tight (e.g. with very long sequences); raise it to amortize kernel-launch overhead. SFT training silently disables this (not supported yet). Only available with `model.impl = "custom"`.

## Memory-Tight Recipe

The kitchen-sink config for fitting large MoE on limited GPUs at acceptable throughput. AC, AC offloading, compile, fused LM head chunking, optimizer offload, and EP auto-resolution are on by default — only CP needs to be set explicitly (and EP overridden if auto-resolution is not desired):

```toml
[trainer.model]
impl = "custom"
ep = 8
cp = 2

[trainer.model.ac]
freq = 1

[trainer.model.ac_offloading]
max_inflight_activations = 1
```

The defaults already cover: fused LM head chunking (`1024`), `torch.compile` (fullgraph=False), AC (full mode), AC offloading (`max_inflight_activations=5`), and optimizer CPU offload. Walks through every memory lever in order: FSDP+EP shard the weights, CP shards the activations along the token dim, AC + AC offloading shrink the activation footprint, fused LM head chunks the loss, `torch.compile` reduces fragmentation, optim offload moves Adam state off GPU. Apply selectively — each knob has a throughput cost.

## SLURM

The `rl`, `sft`, and `inference` entrypoints all submit to SLURM when a `[slurm]` table is present — there's no separate entrypoint.

> **The prime-rl checkout and its `uv` venv must live on a shared filesystem** visible to every node. The generated sbatch script runs a single `uv sync --all-extras --all-packages` on the batch node (not once per node), so all ranks share that one environment — a node-local venv would leave the other nodes stale.

### Activation

A SLURM config is usually a thin overlay that adds `[slurm]` (and `[deployment]` for multi-node) on top of a base config. Configs are composed left-to-right via the `@` CLI syntax — see [Configuration § TOML Composition](configuration.md#toml-composition):

```toml
# my_slurm.toml
output_dir = "/shared/outputs/my-rl"

[slurm]
job_name = "my-rl-run"
```

Launch:

```bash
uv run rl @ base_rl.toml @ my_slurm.toml             # submits via sbatch
uv run rl @ base_rl.toml @ my_slurm.toml --dry-run   # writes the sbatch script + resolved config, exits
```

### `[deployment]` Block

`[deployment]` is a discriminated union picked by `type` — `single_node` or `multi_node` for RL/SFT, with an extra disaggregated variant for inference. RL multi-node:

```toml
[deployment]
type = "multi_node"
num_train_nodes = 2
num_infer_nodes = 1              # optional when inference.deployment defines the node topology
gpus_per_node = 8                # default
nodes_per_fsdp_group = 1         # optional — controls FSDP island size
```

SFT multi-node:

```toml
[deployment]
type = "multi_node"
num_nodes = 2
gpus_per_node = 8
```

### Examples

Full multi-node configs ship under [`examples/advanced/`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/tree/main/examples/advanced):

- [`nemotron-3-super/swe.toml`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/blob/main/examples/advanced/nemotron-3-super/swe.toml) — 4 trainer + 1 inference node RL on a 120B hybrid-Mamba MoE with NCCL weight broadcast.
- [`glm-5.2/`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/tree/main/examples/advanced/glm-5.2) — large-scale and P/D-disaggregated inference across the GLM-5 family.

For inference-only multi-node, set `[deployment] type = "multi_node"` on an inference TOML — each node runs an independent vLLM replica (TP and DP must fit within one node), and the launcher prints one URL per node. Front the URLs with a router or point clients at any of them.

### Custom Templates

For unusual partitions, module loads, or environment setup, supply your own Jinja2 template:

```bash
uv run rl @ my_config.toml --slurm.template-path path/to/my_template.sbatch.j2
```

The default templates live under [`src/prime_rl/templates/`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/tree/main/src/prime_rl/templates) — copy one as a starting point.

## Benchmarking

Every entrypoint supports a `--bench` flag that runs a few warm-up + measurement steps with fake data and prints a rich-formatted throughput / MFU table:

```bash
# SFT trainer alone
uv run sft @ sft.toml --bench
uv run sft ... --data.type fake --data.length variable --bench   # variable-length fake data

# RL trainer alone (no inference involved)
uv run trainer @ train.toml --data.fake --bench

# Inference alone — start the server normally, then bench the orchestrator
uv run inference @ infer.toml
uv run orchestrator @ orch.toml --bench

# Full RL stack (trainer with fake data, inference with real data from orchestrator)
uv run rl @ rl.toml --bench
```

Persist results with `--bench.output-json`. Use this to compare parallelism configs before committing a multi-day run.
